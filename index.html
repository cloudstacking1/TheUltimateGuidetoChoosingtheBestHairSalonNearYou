 <h2>Natural-Looking HighlightsL</h2>
        
        
            <p>Many women come to Honeybliss looking for natural-looking highlights that brighten their overall look without appearing overdone. Our stylists specialize in subtle techniques that give the impression of naturally lightened hair.

<h3>Face-Framing Highlights</h3>



 <p>One of the fastest ways to refresh your style is with face-framing highlights. By strategically lightening sections around the face, our stylists can brighten your complexion, accentuate your features, and give you a youthful glow.</p>

 <p>This technique pairs perfectly with layered cuts or highlights for long hair, creating dimension and movement that <b><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?cid=3424575626295117404"> looks gorgeous</a></b> in both casual and formal settings.</p>

  <h2>FAQs</h2>
<div class="faq" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
  <h3>1. What is the difference between balayage highlights and traditional highlights?
</h3>
  <p>Balayage highlights are painted freehand onto the hair, creating a soft, blended effect that grows out naturally. Traditional highlights typically use foil or caps to section hair and produce more uniform streaks. Many clients prefer balayage because it offers a more natural-looking highlights result and lower maintenance.</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
  <h3>2. How often should I get my highlights redone?
</h3>
  <p>It depends on the technique, your hair growth, and the type of highlights (blonde, face-framing, ombre, etc.). Generally, balayage can last 3–6 months before needing a refresh, while more structured foil highlights may need touch-ups every 8–12 weeks. Your stylist at Honeybliss Salon can recommend a schedule tailored to your hair type and color goals.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">
  <h3>3. Can highlights damage my hair?
</h3>
  <p>Any coloring service has the potential to cause damage if not done correctly or if hair is already compromised. However, when done by experienced stylists using quality products (like at Honeybliss Salon), the risk is minimized. Deep conditioning treatments, bond repair therapies, and gentle aftercare help preserve hair health and reduce damage from hair color highlights.</p>
